# Automated Machine learning Lab

## Create Azure resources

Create the resources enumerated above (it is better to have the resources enabled ahead of time). Some of these resources depend on Azure account permissions, so this aspect needs to be verified ahead of time. For Enterprise Accounts, creating a service principle account needs the IT/Identity Team to create a service principle account that you can use.

### Resource Group

Create a resource Group: name it: AMLv2Lab
